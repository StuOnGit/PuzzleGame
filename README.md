## Details of the Game

* Every piece of the Image is wrapped in `ImagePanel`  that extends the `JPanel` from [Swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html) framework, and is stored in a Matrix of `ImagePanel` variable.
* A copy of this matrix is called `shuffledImages` and these are the images that are changing while the shuffle and movement of the click.
* The restart button will copy inside this shuffledImages variable the first Matrix where are stored the correct order of the images.
* The movement happens when the user click a panel **near** the blank (TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, RIGHT) and the image of the one is setted to blank and vice versa.
